# Abisite
This is a small side project we created to easily manage surveys for our A-level magazine.
Some members of our team wanted to give sheets to all 120 students to answer the questions, but I was not quite interested in reading through about 1000 answers...

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
